# Advanced Usage & Tutorials

__pyNS__ enables using Neuroscout data in novel ways not (yet!) supported by the web application. 
Here we highlight some of these advanced use cases and provide tutorials for how to use them.

* Batch-creation of analyses and meta-analytic estimation across datasets.
  This best exemplified by the Neuroscout paper, and the accomanying [jupyter book](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-paper/).

* Downloading data from Neuroscout, including full predictor time courses and image data
  To learn more, see the official [fetching tutorial](https://pyns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fetching.html) in the 
  official pyNS documentation.

* [Ridge cross-validated regression workflow](ridge-encoding.ipynb).
