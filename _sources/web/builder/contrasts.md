# Contrasts

In this tab, you can define `contrasts` to compute at the `first-level` after the `design-matrix` is fit to the `fMRI activation` `time-course`.

As there are often no experimental `conditions` in `naturalistic studies`, it often makes the most sense to simply propagate the individual `estimates` for each `predictor` of `interest` (e.g. `non-confounds`).

We can achieve this using `"dummy contrasts"`, in which each `Predictor` is given a `dummy-coded` `contrast` of the same name.

To do this for all `non-confounds`, simply click `Generate Dummy Contrasts`.

```{admonition} Note
If you go back to the `Predictors` tab and edit the `predictor` list, you may have to re-generate `dummy contrasts`.
```

## Defining a custom contrast

To define a `contrast`, click `Add Contrast`. First, you must give the `contrast` a name.
Next, select the `predictors` to include in this `contrast`. All `predictors` not selected will be given a `weight` of `0`.
Finally, enter the weights for the selected predictors.

In this example, we are contrasting `building` and `daylight` using `t` contrast.

As in the transformations tab, you can re-order, trash, and edit existing contrasts.
