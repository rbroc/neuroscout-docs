# HRF Convolution

In this tab, you can select which `predictors` you'd like to convolve with the `canonical haemodynamic-response function` (`HRF`).

Typically, you'll want to `convolve` all `non-confounds`. You can easily do this by clicking `Select All Non-Confounds`.

As in the `Predictors` tab, you can perform a full-text search over all the `predictors` you previously selected.

For now, we are applying a ["SPM" style](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Haemodynamic_Response_Function) `HRF`, with no `derivatives`.

```{admonition} Note
In reality, `HRF` `convolution` is another `transformation` that is applied after all other `transformations`.
