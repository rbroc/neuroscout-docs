# What is Neuroscout?

_Neuroscout is an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic public fMRI datasets._

Using our interactive analysis builder, you can choose among [dozens of naturalistic fMRI datasets](https://neuroscout.org/datasets) and easily build statistical models [in your browser](web/builder/intro.md). We provide [hundreds of pre-extracted predictors](https://neuroscout.org/predictors), in addition to supporting custom user-uploaded predictors.

Analyses can be downloaded and executed it in one line of code using [Neuroscout-CLI](cli/intro.md), and results are automatically uploaded to [NeuroVault](https://www.neurovault.org/) for easy sharing with colleagues.
